 # NDAF
This is a simple script written in Mathematica 9.0, to perform numerical calculations on 1D structure of neutrino dominated accretion disks (NDAF).
Notebook preparation.nb defines fundamental constants, equations, and provide a naive bisection solver.
Notebook solutions.nb solves a pair of algebraic equations that discribes the 1D structure of the NDAF.
